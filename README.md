# Predicting-Heart-Disease-Project
This repository hosts a Predictive Modeling Project that I developed as part of my coursework. The project explores various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to implement and compare different algorithms to assess their performance in predicting outcomes based on historical data. The data used in this project was acquired from Kaggle, a popular platform for datasets.
  Algorithms Implemented:
    **Logistic Regression:** A foundational statistical model used for binary classification problems, helpful for interpreting feature importance.
    **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM):** An ensemble technique known for its high accuracy in structured data and robustness against overfitting.
    **Neural Networks:** A powerful approach to pattern recognition and can handle complex relationships within data.
    **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting.
